        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>e’ve come a long way from our modest and measured beginnings on the back of a commitment to quality that has never been compromised and a focus that has never wavered.
        sports club has always strived to deliver only the best for our esteemed members and it is that vow that has led to the club you see in its current avatar. Today, NSCI is one of the country’s finest institutions in almost every aspect spanning across food and beverage, amenities, conveniences, sports, entertainment and even nightlife!

A case in point, The Sardar atel Stadium has been renovated regularly since its inception, always improving its infrastructure and facilities in order to extract every last ounce of performance on the sporting front. With a centrally air-conditioned indoor stadium and a seating capacity of 5000, the Stadium is primed to be the epicentre of some of Indian sports’ finest moments.

Aside from that, the club has pushed forward with a surfeit of new initiatives including a brand new health club and spa, banquet rooms of every size and for every occasion, and enough restaurants to satisfy every palette. The newer projects also include a massive parking facility for about 800 cars in the basement. Our sole endeavour is to ensure that you have a fantastic experience irrespective of whether you came to buy groceries, to support your child’s activities, to meet friends, spend quality time with family or even simply to conduct business.

It is our pleasure to serve you, the members, because you are the heart and soul of the club and we are very proud to have the opportunity to do so.
